# Modular Discord Bot

A modern, modular Discord bot built with Python and the `discord.py` library.  
This bot uses a Cog-based architecture, making it easy to extend, manage, and maintain.

## Features
- **Modular Design:** Commands and events are organized into separate 'Cogs' (e.g., general, moderation, events) for clean and scalable code.
- **Configuration Driven:** All sensitive data (like tokens) and server-specific settings (like channel IDs) are managed via a `.env` file.
- **Comprehensive Logging:** Detailed logging for events, commands, and errors, both in the console and optionally to a file.
- **General Commands:** Includes essential commands like `ping` and `info`.
- **Moderation Tools:** Comes with commands like `clear` (purge messages) and `rules` posting.
- **Event Handling:** Logs important server events such as member joins/leaves, message edits/deletes, and voice channel activity.

## 🚀 Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to get the bot running on your own server.

### 1. Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- A Discord Bot Token from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications)

### 2. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/theprelior/creator-log.git
cd creator-log
````

### 3. Set Up the Environment File

Create a file named `.env` in the root directory of the project.
This file will store your secret token and channel IDs.

Example `.env`:

```ini
# --- BOT SETTINGS ---
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN="YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN_HERE"
COMMAND_PREFIX="!"

# --- SERVER CHANNEL IDs ---
# You need to enable Developer Mode in Discord to get these IDs.
LOG_CHANNEL_ID="YOUR_LOG_CHANNEL_ID"
WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID="YOUR_WELCOME_CHANNEL_ID"
GOODBYE_CHANNEL_ID="YOUR_GOODBYE_CHANNEL_ID"
RULES_CHANNEL_ID="YOUR_RULES_CHANNEL_ID"
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

Install the required Python libraries using the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Run the Bot

Start the bot with:

```bash
python app.py
```

If everything is configured correctly, you will see log messages in your console indicating that the bot has successfully connected to Discord.

## Usage

The default command prefix is `!`. You can change this in the `.env` file.

* `!ping` — Checks the bot's latency
* `!info` — Displays information about the bot
* `!clear <amount>` — Deletes a specified number of messages
* `!rules <rules text>` — Posts the server rules in the designated channel

```
